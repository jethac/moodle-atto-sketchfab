# moodle-atto-sketchfab
[Sketchfab][1] embedding comes to Atto! This plugin contains an Atto toolbar button that simplifies adding Sketchfab content to rich content areas within [Moodle][2] - just click the button, paste a link to a Sketchfab model (e.g. http://sketchfab.com/models/028d91eadb424857a82d119ea5a269a5) and the plugin will do the work of embedding a good-looking thumbnail into your post for you.

Combine this plugin with [moodle-filter-sketchfab-embed][3], a text filter plugin which provides options for automatically replacing these thumbnails with the embedded Sketchfab viewer.

## Quick install
1. Put this entire directory at PATHTOMOODLE/lib/editor/atto/plugins/sketchfab
